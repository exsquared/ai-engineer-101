# ðŸ§  Checkpoint Project: From Rules to Predictions

---

## ðŸªœ Why Now?

Youâ€™ve just learned how models make predictions â€” and more importantly, how to handle uncertainty using confidence scores and fallback logic.

Now itâ€™s time to zoom out and compare three different ways to solve the same problem:

- Hard-coded logic
- Pattern matching
- Machine learning

This is your chance to see where each technique shines â€” and where it breaks.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Use everything youâ€™ve learned so far to compare three ways of solving a real-world classification problem:

1. Rule-based logic
2. Pattern-based heuristics (like regex)
3. Machine learning (your first trained model)

By the end, youâ€™ll reflect on where each approach worked â€” and where it fell short.
