# 🚀 Scaling, Microservices & DevOps for AI Systems  

*From Local Notebooks to Real APIs That Don’t Fall Over*

---

## 🧭 Why Are We Here?

It’s one thing to build a model. It’s another to ship it — safely, scalably, and observably.

In this chapter, we’ll show how to:

- Scale a FastAPI AI service into production
- Handle retries, caching, queues, and timeouts
- Introduce observability and health monitoring
- Think like a microservice engineer, not a data scientist

By the end, your model won’t just work — it’ll *work reliably under pressure*.

---

## 🏗️ System Design at a Glance

Here’s what a real-world AI service looks like in production:

```txt
Client ───> API Gateway ───> FastAPI AI Service ───> Model
                           └──> Redis / Queue / Logs
```

Key components:

- **FastAPI server**: Exposes model as a REST API
- **Queue (optional)**: Buffers long-running jobs
- **Cache (Redis)**: Prevents repeated work
- **Logger / Tracer**: Tracks usage and errors
- **Retry layer**: Handles flaky services
- **Health probe**: Signals readiness

---

## ⚙️ Build a Scalable FastAPI AI Service

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

app = FastAPI()

client = OpenAI()

class Query(BaseModel):
    prompt: str

@app.post("/generate")
def generate(q: Query):
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": q.prompt}],
            timeout=10,
        )
        return {"result": response.choices[0].message.content}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

---

## 🧠 Add Caching with Redis

```python
import redis
import hashlib

r = redis.Redis()

def cache_key(prompt: str):
    return "gen:" + hashlib.sha1(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()

@app.post("/generate")
def generate(q: Query):
    key = cache_key(q.prompt)
    if (cached := r.get(key)):
        return {"result": cached.decode()}

    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
    result = response.choices[0].message.content
    r.set(key, result, ex=3600)
    return {"result": result}
```

---

## 🔁 Add Retry Logic

```python
import backoff

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, Exception, max_tries=3)
def call_model(prompt):
    return client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

Retries help handle flaky upstreams (rate limits, timeouts, etc.).

---

## 📊 Add Logging and Tracing

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("uvicorn.error")

@app.post("/generate")
def generate(q: Query):
    logger.info(f"Prompt: {q.prompt}")
    ...
```

✅ Use structured logs (JSON) for observability platforms like:

- Datadog
- Prometheus
- Grafana Loki
- OpenTelemetry + LangSmith

---

## ✅ Add Health Check Endpoint

```python
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Your orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes) uses this to decide whether to route traffic or restart.

---

## 🧵 Queueing for Long Jobs (Optional)

For heavyweight tasks (e.g. fine-tuning, PDF parsing), offload to a queue:

```txt
FastAPI ───> Redis Queue ───> Worker (Celery, RQ)
```

This lets you return 202 Accepted and poll for result later.

---

## 🧠 Microservice Thinking: What to Separate?

- Separate **UI** from **inference**  
- Separate **retrieval** from **generation**  
- Separate **controller logic** (agent) from tools

Split services by:

- Different latency profiles
- Different observability and security needs
- Different ownership teams

---

## 🧰 Infra Tools You’ll Want

| Tool | Why It Helps |
|------|--------------|
| **Docker** | Consistent deployment across envs |
| **Kubernetes / ECS** | Scales your containerized API |
| **Redis** | Cache or queue layer |
| **Prometheus + Grafana** | Metrics & dashboards |
| **Traceloop / LangSmith / Phoenix** | LLM tracing & debugging |

## 🧠 Recap: What You Just Built

✅ A FastAPI service that wraps a model  
✅ Observability: logging, retries, health checks  
✅ Caching + optional queue  
✅ A pattern to grow into a real AI backend

---

## ❓Reflection Questions

1. What’s the first bottleneck you’d hit if 10k users hit this model?  
2. How would you version and deploy a new model without downtime?  
3. Which part of your API stack needs retries, caching, or batching?

---

## 🧪 Mini Quiz

**Q1.** What’s the benefit of Redis here?  
✅ a) Avoid recomputing the same prompt response

**Q2.** Why should long-running jobs use queues?  
✅ b) So they don’t block incoming API requests

---

## 🎯 Microproject

🔧 Build a deployable GPT-backed FastAPI app with:

- `/generate` endpoint
- Redis caching
- Basic logging
- A `/health` endpoint

**Bonus:** Deploy it on Render or Fly.io for free.

---

## ✅ Exit Outcome

You now:

- Can structure and scale your AI microservice
- Know how to deploy, observe, retry, and cache safely
- Understand when to queue, when to batch, and when to split logic
