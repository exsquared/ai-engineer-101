# What’s Next?  

*Your Beginner AI Engineering Journey Ends Here — But You're Just Getting Started*

---

## 🏁 You’ve Built a Real Foundation

By now, you’ve gone from:

- Rule-based decisions → Model-based reasoning  
- Single-turn prompts → Tool-using agents  
- Text-only LLMs → Multimodal intelligence

You’ve shipped:

- Classifiers  
- APIs  
- RAG systems  
- Agents  
- Vision-enhanced prototypes

You're not just playing with AI. You’re **engineering it.**

## 🚀 Where You’re Going Next (Intermediate Track Preview)

### 🧠 Embeddings and Vector Search

- How semantic search works
- Chunking, indexing, filtering, and reranking

### 🛠️ RAG Architecture at Scale

- Structured documents
- Metadata filtering
- Hybrid search strategies

### 🧠 Prompt Composition + Dynamic Routing

- Few-shot, zero-shot, train-of-thought
- Switching between prompts and tools

### ⚙️ Observability, Logging, Tracing

- Monitoring AI behavior like APIs
- Tools like LangSmith, Traceloop, Phoenix

### 👥 Advanced Agents + Memory

- Stateful assistants
- Task planning and retries
- Auto mode vs. human-in-the-loop

## 🎯 Reflection Questions Before You Continue

1. What kind of AI systems do you want to build?
2. What were your biggest mindset shifts through this beginner track?
3. What part of the stack do you want to specialize in next?
