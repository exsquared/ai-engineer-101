# ðŸš€ Guided Project: AI Ticket Classifier (End-to-End)

---

## ðŸªœ Why Now?

After learning how to measure your model's performance â€” using precision, recall, and threshold tuning â€” you're ready for your first end-to-end AI project.

This is where everything comes together: modeling, confidence scores, evaluation, and deployment.

Letâ€™s go build a real, working AI system.
