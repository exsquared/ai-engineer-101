# 🚀 Final Capstone Project: Compose and Deploy Your Own AI-Powered System

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?

You’ve completed the beginner track — from classical ML to modern LLMs, from prompting to agents, from local prototypes to scalable APIs.

Now it’s time to build a complete AI system — one that shows your skills as a builder, engineer, and system thinker.

---

## 📦 What You'll Build

Design and deploy a real AI-powered application using:

- LLMs (GPT-4 / OpenAI / Claude)
- Prompt composition + context injection
- Tool calling or API orchestration
- Optional: memory, agent loop, or multimodal input

This is your chance to demonstrate:
✅ Technical depth  
✅ Practical creativity  
✅ Product-minded design

## 🧠 Pick One of These Capstone Tracks

### 🅰️ Track A: Knowledge Assistant / RAG Bot

Build a system that:

- Answers user questions from private documents (e.g., support tickets, product docs, HR policies)
- Injects context into LLM prompts (manual or vector search)
- Decides when to escalate or disclaim confidently

Bonus:

- Add a feedback loop for user corrections  
- Add memory (conversation tracking)  
- Add a UI or chat interface

---

### 🅱️ Track B: Agent-Based Task Orchestrator

Build a mini agent that:

- Accepts a task or instruction
- Plans a sequence of steps
- Calls tools or APIs (math, search, databases, etc.)
- Responds with the completed result

Bonus:

- Use LangChain or function-calling  
- Show logging for thought/action/observation steps  
- Add retry/fallback logic

---

### 🅲 Track C: Multimodal GenAI App

Build a vision-enhanced app that:

- Takes image or screenshot input
- Uses GPT-4V or DALL·E to process or generate images
- Returns a visual or structured response

Examples:

- Screenshot explainer  
- Product image generator  
- Visual bug checker or chart interpreter

---

## 🔨 Tech Stack Options

Use anything you’ve already seen in this course:

- FastAPI or Streamlit (Ch. 9–10)  
- OpenAI API (Ch. 8 onward)  
- Manual prompt composition (Ch. 8c)  
- Basic fallback logic (Ch. 8c)  
- Function-calling or LangChain (Ch. 12)  
- Vision tools (Ch. 13)

---

## 📋 Capstone Deliverables

Your submission must include:

1. ✅ System Description
    - What problem are you solving?
    - What use cases does it serve?

2. ✅ Architecture Diagram
    - Show how prompts, tools, and APIs connect

3. ✅ Prompt Examples
    - Show at least 3 prompt variations you tested and refined

4. ✅ Codebase (GitHub or Zip)
    - Clean, runnable app or notebook with clear readme

5. ✅ Output Examples
    - Screenshots or logs showing real user flows

6. ✅ Reflection Write-Up
    - What worked? What failed? What surprised you?
    - What would you improve in a v2?

7. ✅ Ethics / Reliability Statement
    - How do you prevent misuse, hallucination, or bias?
    - What fallback logic did you implement?

## 🏅 Capstone Badge

Completing this project earns you the **“AI Systems Engineer” badge** — recognition that you’re not just prompting, you’re architecting.

---

## 🧐 Reflection Prompts (Optional)

- What part of the system challenged your assumptions?  
- What design decisions had the biggest impact on usability?  
- Where did you choose to trust the model, and where not to?

---

## 🌟 Congratulations!

You’ve built your own AI-powered app — from problem to prompt to product.  
This is just the beginning. The next step? Start solving problems in the real world with what you now know.

You’re not just an AI engineer. You’re a system builder. 🚀
