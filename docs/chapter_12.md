# Let LLMs Read Your Data  
### _Agents, Embeddings, Retrieval, and Context Injection_

---

## 🧭 Why Are We Here?

Imagine hiring a genius intern with perfect grammar, creativity, and logic skills — but no memory of your company, products, or documentation.

That’s your LLM.

They’re trained on the internet, not your internal wikis, support tickets, or sales PDFs. So when you ask, “What’s the refund policy for product X?”, they hallucinate, guessing wildly.

**What if you could just _give them your docs_ and have them answer smartly — without retraining?**

That’s the magic of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea (No Math Needed)

> **RAG = Search + Smart Text Generation**

Instead of asking the LLM to answer from scratch, we:
1. **Search for relevant content** from your custom data (PDFs, docs, pages).
2. **Inject** that content into the prompt.
3. Let the **LLM generate** a grounded, useful response using that real data.

We’re building a system that can:
- Ingest and understand custom documents (with _embeddings_)
- Find relevant chunks when asked a question (with _vector search_)
- Feed those chunks into the LLM (via _context injection_)

## 🛠️ New Concepts You’ll Meet

| Concept | What It Means | Tool |
|--------|----------------|------|
| **Embedding** | Turn a sentence into a list of numbers to compare meaning | `OpenAI`, `sentence-transformers` |
| **Vector store** | Search based on meaning, not just keywords | `FAISS`, `Chroma`, `Pinecone` |
| **Context injection** | Add relevant data directly into your prompt | Native to any LLM |
| **LangChain** | Glue toolkit to combine LLMs + retrievers + APIs | `LangChain` |
| **LangFlow** | Drag-and-drop GUI to visualize LangChain flows | `LangFlow` |

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

You: “What’s our refund policy for product X?”

Your assistant:
- Searches the docs
- Finds the right paragraph
- Summarizes it:  
  > “Customers have 30 days to request a refund…”

That’s a retrieval-augmented response.

---

## 💻 Let’s Build One

### Step 1: Load and Split Documents

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("refund_policy.txt")
docs = loader.load()
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)
```

---

### Step 2: Embed and Store

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
```

---

### Step 3: Retrieve and Inject Context

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

qa_chain.run("What’s the refund policy?")
```

✅ Done: you’ve created a semantic search → context injection → answer pipeline.

## 🔁 RAG vs Fine-Tuning

| Strategy | Use When... |
|----------|-------------|
| **RAG** | You want dynamic, updatable, explainable Q&A |
| **Fine-tuning** | You want fixed tone or style, not factual grounding |
| **Hybrid** | You want smart retrieval and custom behavior |

---

## 🧵 Behind the Scenes

When a question comes in:
1. It’s converted to an embedding (like a “meaning vector”)
2. You find the closest doc chunks in the vector store
3. You build a prompt like:

```
Use this info to answer:
[chunk 1]
[chunk 2]

Q: What’s the refund window?
```

4. The model responds — **grounded in your data**

---

## 🔍 LangFlow: Optional GUI

If you want to **drag-and-drop** your pipeline visually, try [LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow).  
It works like Figma for LLM systems.

You can:
- Add loaders, retrievers, prompt templates, LLMs
- Connect and run chains
- Export working code

---

## 🧠 Toolformer, ReAct, and Planner-Executor (Optional Deep Dive)

### 🔹 Toolformer

A model trained to decide **when to use a tool** (like a retriever or calculator) — and to learn that during pretraining.  
You can simulate it with `[TOOL:...]` markers and custom execution middleware.

### 🔹 ReAct

Chain of “Reason → Act → Observe → Reason”.  
Useful for agents deciding what to retrieve, when, and how to verify.

### 🔹 Planner-Executor

One LLM plans steps. Another (or the same) executes them using retrieval, tool calls, or memory.

## 📦 Microproject: Build Your Own Document-Aware Assistant

1. Load a `.txt` or `.pdf` file
2. Chunk, embed, and store it in FAISS
3. Write a FastAPI endpoint `/ask`
4. Inject relevant chunks into the prompt
5. Return the grounded answer
6. Add a fallback if no chunks are confidently found

Bonus:
- Add a LangFlow UI
- Track token usage
- Stream the response
