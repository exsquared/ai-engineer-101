# Evaluating & Debugging AI Models—Beyond Accuracy

## 🎯 Why Are We Here?

Ever wonder how Netflix knows exactly what shows you'll binge or how Instagram keeps you scrolling endlessly? These apps don't just work—they work brilliantly, thanks to meticulous evaluation and debugging of their AI models. In this chapter, you'll master how to evaluate and debug your AI with a fun, practical approach, ensuring your apps stay smart, efficient, and user-friendly!

## ⚠️ The Accuracy Trap

Imagine you've built an AI to identify urgent customer-support tickets. Your model proudly announces: 
> “I'm 95% accurate!”

Sounds fantastic! But wait:

- Only 5% of your tickets are genuinely urgent.
- Your AI simply predicts "non-urgent" every time—and still hits 95% accuracy!

That's not AI; that's cheating.

> **High accuracy ≠ useful AI.**

## 📈 Understanding Evaluation—The Fun Way!

### 🍕 Precision and Recall Explained (With Pizza!)

- **Precision**: If your AI shouts "Pizza's here!", how often does the pizza actually arrive?
- **Recall**: If pizza really does arrive, did your AI call it correctly?

Precision ensures you're not crying wolf, and recall ensures you're not missing any delicious pizzas.

## 🛠 Practical Hands-On: Metrics & Thresholds

Let's explore how thresholds impact your model practically:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Model predictions and probabilities
y_scores = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Probability for 'urgent'

# Adjust thresholds to tune sensitivity
for threshold in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]:
    print(f"Threshold: {threshold}")
    predictions = (y_scores > threshold).astype(int)
    print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

Different thresholds change your model's behavior:

- **Lower threshold** (0.3): More urgent tickets flagged (high recall, lower precision).
- **Higher threshold** (0.7): Fewer urgent tickets flagged (high precision, lower recall).

## 🐞 Debugging: Your AI Detective Moment

Let's turn debugging into exciting detective work:

### 🔍 Step 1: Spot the Misclassifications

```python
actual_orders = ["pizza", "salad", "pizza", "salad"]
predicted_orders = ["pizza", "salad", "salad", "salad"]

for idx, (actual, predicted) in enumerate(zip(actual_orders, predicted_orders), 1):
    if actual != predicted:
        print(f"Order #{idx} misclassified! (Predicted: {predicted}, Actual: {actual})")
```

### 🧐 Step 2: Find Out Why

- Check if the AI confuses "salad" toppings with pizza toppings.
- Spot common mistakes like unclear examples or poor labeling.

### 🛠 Step 3: Fix It!

- **Improve your data:** clearer, better-labeled examples.
- **Adjust thresholds:** make the model more or less sensitive.
- **Blend methods:** combine AI predictions with simpler rules.

## 🎮 Mini-Experiment: Pizza Debugging Adventure

Put your detective skills to practical use:

```python
food_orders = ["cheese pizza", "veggie pizza", "green salad"]
order_labels = ["pizza", "pizza", "salad"]

X_test = vectorizer.transform(food_orders)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

precision = precision_score(order_labels, predictions, pos_label="pizza")
recall = recall_score(order_labels, predictions, pos_label="pizza")

print("Pizza Precision:", precision)
print("Pizza Recall:", recall)

# Identify issues clearly
for food, actual, predicted in zip(food_orders, order_labels, predictions):
    if actual != predicted:
        print(f"Misclassified: '{food}' (Predicted: {predicted}, Actual: {actual})")
```

🎉 **Congratulations, you've just debugged your AI pizza detector!**
